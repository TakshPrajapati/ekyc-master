### Problem Statement (PS) 

- Currently Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process OR non-interactive online process.  
- Create an online interactive process to do video KYC which is intuitive and self-sufficient. KYC should capture the user’s live photograph
- and their basic details like name, DOB, address, pan card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, type of employment in a conversational manner.
- This tool should be highly inclusive and should have high reach across languages and generations irrespective of financial and education gap.
